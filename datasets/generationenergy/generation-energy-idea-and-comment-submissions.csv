4,21-Apr-17,Idea/Idée,Mantra Energy (a Canadian company) the holy grail for a Carbon Neutral World.,,"Mantra's technology, the conversion of CO2 to saleable chemicals (such as formic acid, syngas and others) is one of the few technologies which is business as wellas enviromental friendly. It reduces the cost of energy, it will create jobs and it will provide a carbon neutral environment. Business friendly - with a Tax on Carbon in place and the cost of sequestration of carbon, businesses will be forced to raise it's prices on their products to cover these addition expenditures. By reducing Carbon emissions, Mantra's technology would remove the cost of a Carbon Tax and sequestration, as it would turn a waste product (CO2) to saleable chemicals. This at the same time make the business carbon neutral. This would add revenue to business which in turn would allow them to offer their products at a reduce prices. Economically- business do what business do and pass on their added cost to the end consumer. This in turn takes money out the economy which leads to an economic downturn. Mantra's technology would eliminate those extra expenditures to businesses, thus allowing businesses to charge their customers less for their products. This would free up more expendable capital per individual which would be beneficial for the economy. An addition boost to the economy is that one of Mantra's main by products chemicals is syngas, which can be converted to diesel and home heating fuel. This will drive down the price of both diesel and heating fuel, benefiting businesses and the end consumer thous the over all economy.  Job creations. Mantra's technology takes wasteful CO2 and converts it saleable chemicals. It will create jobs because some one will have to build the units, someone will have to maintain the units, some one will have to sell the chemicals, someone will have to gather the chemicals and some will have to transport the chemicals. Jobs. Cleaner energy future. At the very least Mantra's technology is carbon neutral but it also has the potential to greatly reduce carbon from the environment based on what chemicals it produces. I only state Carbon Neutral because certain chemical produced by Mantra's technology especially syngas (the most valuable one can be converted to diesel fuel) eventually will be burned, while others (example formic acid) takes carbon out of the atmosphere and when used puts none back. Currently Mantra Energy is waiting to hear if it was approved for a grant to bring it technology from lab to market at the CCCI in Vancouver.  ",,Non-governmental organization (NGO),Organisation non gouvernemental (ONG),Fossil Fuels; Oil Sands; Innovation; Industry; Clean Tech; Climate Change; Renewables; Environment,Combustibles fossiles; Sables bitumineux; Innovation; Industrie; Les technologies propres; Chandements climatiques; Énergies renouvelables; L’environnement,Innovation,Innovation,28,,0,

7,24-Apr-17,Idea/Idée,Common sense.,,"The argument over whether or not to make breakthroughs in renewable energies is moot, regardless of the climate change debate. Our current energy infrastructure is entirely foundationed in resources that we know are depleting, and will one day be exhausted. The best way to make ""fiscal thinking"" come in line with a sustainable future is to incentivize the fiscal thinkers. Case in point, the CBC's program ""Dragons Den"". The fiscal thinking ""dragons"" turned down an opportunity with an engineer who wanted to build a tidal powered generation station off of the East coast. The only obstacle cited by the dragons was that they would never see return on their investment. They could find no issue, but a monetary issue. In the end they called the engineer crazy, told him that they would love to get drunk with him, but wouldn't give him a plugged nickel. Not a single one of those dragons was able to see that clean, plentiful, sustainable, low environmental impacting energy was something to want to be a part of, because they were afraid of loosing paper and numbers on a computer. No one wants to lose their paper or computer numbers, and that is understandable so it would seem that subsidies are in order. Your next big hurdle comes from Joe working person. They want jobs, and employers want people who are the best for those jobs. This is a main proponent for the old sad story of ""when the mill shut down"" or ""revinew prices tanked"" and those people who depended on the industry. The major concern when these economic events or corrections occur, to the normal person, is that they have been compartmentalized, into a specialized part of the work force. A seamstress likely doesn't know how to smelt metal at the refinery, when the automated pants factory comes to town, and the refinery staff likely don't know how to bake cakes at the bakery, when there is no market call for their skill set. The same is true in the energy sector. By insentivising companies to branch out, you will in kind incentivize the work force that supports that company. For example, if Jane Doe's oil company received some sort of tax break or a levy against them laxxed for funding or investing in clean and renewable energy, eventually Jane's Oil Inc. becomes Jane's Energy and Innovation conglomerative. All of a sudden the share holders of Jane's are working toward more efficient solar panels, and miniaturizing wind mills to prevent bird deaths, MSR nuclear power. Suddenly Bob's copper wire consortium and it's share holders are really interested in microwave energy transmission so that they can have their name on the first orbital solar stations. In turn these companies need staff working and engineering towards the prescribed goals. Incentivize them further, by creating training programs and opportunities for existing staff. Create a business environment where less wire being built means more technicians and engineers are needed, instead of more people destitute because the wire factory shut down. We also need common sense in how we get to an all renewable future. Just because there are solar panels, and electric cars that work in California, doesn't mean that they will work everywhere. WIth the point being that if something is going to work in the future, that is not a reason to stop using what works now. As it stands the ""No more oil keep it in the soil"" mentality leaves a lot of people cold and hungry in the dark. No one through away their bow and arrow when the first musket was introduced, and the same should be expected in the energy sector. Energy is the corner stone of the foundation of modern society. If we take the time and put in the effort to revolutionize energy, society will move with it. If we remove that cornerstone it collapses.",,General public,Public générale,,,Renewable; Finance,Renewable; La finance,10,,0,

Without a good pipeline infrastructure we lose on two fronts a.) royalty revenues lost from the heavily discounted crude that we sell to the USA, we could be getting market prices for our resources. b.) paying out higher prices for imported oil that we don't need to import because we have it here already. On the social aspect we are also helping to support countries that have terrible human rights and worker safety practices. Building pipelines will also cut down the carbon footprint required to transport our crude and create good paying jobs all across the country.  2. Alberta energy industry was created with the Hep of public funds. So why should we not pair the energy industry's with our governments again. Our refineries are old and or not feasible to start again. They are too costly for any one company or multiple companies to invest in building as the ROA is too far down the line. However with the knowledge and expertise of the energy industries and the backing of government support a great partnership could be built with building new modern energy efficient refineries. All of these can be places in several places across Canada from North to south, east, central and west. Large quantities of skilled jobs would be created, from academia, science and technology, trades and labourers. The tax revenues from these jobs will fund government and partial profits and or loans from the government to fund these project would also come back. So this case it would be a double dip(so to speak) for the government.   3. Inspire new innovations. Provide energy companies tax insensitives for funding research and development of new cleaner technologies. Energy companies will also make the switch to other forms of energy when the time is right. Help them want to start developing this sooner than later. More funding for research and development will help ideas become realities.    Canada has done a lot a lot of things right with our energy sectors.

37,03-May-17,Idea/Idée,Encourage Community Solar PV programs,,"Community solar programs like Grid Solar or Solarize can help families deploy solar on their rooftops and save money. Community solar programs can reduce the deployment of solar energy by a substantial amount. Solar panels are getting cheaper every year and solar energy is now the cheapest source of energy in many countries. The objective of these programs will be to offer a solar rooftop at $1 / watt. A typical family will need a 5 to 10 Kw system, community solar programs will make it easier for families to obtain competitive financing for the solar programs. The community solar programs will reduce the overhead and soft costs of installing solar  (marketing, administration, permitting) to a minimum. Community solar can help reach all of the objectives: - Create jobs in the solar sector installation sector, deploying solar energy will provide jobs for solar panel installers, solar system designers and business managers. The supply chain for solar panels, inverters and components will also be a good source of good paying jobs. Canada is home to leading solar panel plants and leading edge inverter makers. We need to encourage more entrepreneurs to enter the sector, this is the best time to enter the field. - Maintain affordable price for energy. Solar energy is now the cheapest source of energy, electricity from solar energy was offered for a price of 2.9 cents / KwH, this is lower than Natural gas. This price was offered in the UAE, Chili, and Morroco which have better insolation but the Sun also shines in Canada (as seen in the attached image) and as panel prices continue to decline we can expect a similar price in Canada. Successful community solar PV projects already exist such as ( http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/funding/current-funding-programs/cef/4967 ), this initiative will encourage more community solar PV projects and help coordinate between them to facilitate group buys and sharing of best practices.

46,6-May-17,Idea/Idée,Recycling the smart way to reduce CO2,,"It wasn't that long ago we handled our trash by piling it up on a plot of land. After awhile of getting tired of the sight, the smell and the increase in vermin., we decided to use the scientific technique called ""out of site out or mind approach"". We buried it, figuring what we can't see wouldn't hurt us. Boy, were we wrong. Methane deposited built up and exploded, underground water supplies became undrinkable and once rich soil became contaminated. Something had to be done that was more friendly to the environment yet didn't put a burden on us  economically. We put our heads together and came up with a better way, recycling. What recycling did was to take the trash business and make it more environmental friendly. It did this by us  separating contaminates from the trash and by reusing certain trash to make saleable products which in turn greatly reduced the amount of trash being buried. It also reduced a major economical burden to communities. Before the communities were spending large sum money to rid of the trash and not receiving any thing economically back. Recycling, gave certain trash economic value which communities could realize  possible revenue from. Which brings us to CO2 reduction. The current approach where most of the research dollars are being spent to rid ourselves of wasteful CO2 is by sequestrating. Sequestrating is the gathering of CO2, taking to a designated site and burying it. Letting future generations worry about it's side effects to the environment. Sound familiar. Sequestrating, put a major economic burden on business, individuals  and the government without any economic return to them. So what to do. Recycle. Currently there is small Canadian company that just may have the solution. Mantra Energy Alternative Ldt, whose technology carbon conversion is lab proven to turn wasteful CO2 to saleable marketable chemicals. While the government waste billions of dollars trying to find ways to sequestrate CO2 , Mantra Energy Alternative's technology carbon conversion sits on the lab shelf.  What does carbon conversion do for the environment and the economy. By converting CO2 waste to chemicals it eliminates the need of the economic burden of sequestrating of CO2. By converting CO2 to chemicals, CO2 produced by fossil burning companies would be greatly reduced going in to the atmosphere. The chemicals produce have saleable value which would bring additional revenues to the companies and reduce prices to their consumers. Unlike sequestrating, which offers no economic benefits, jobs created by carbon conversion would be self paying by the chemicals produced and sold. It is time we learn from history. The history of the trash business has shown us the path that should be taken. We should stop trying to bury our problem of excess CO2  and take steps to recycle it. We can start by investing in lab proven technologies such as Mantra Energy Alternatives ldt.    ",,Non-governmental organization (NGO),Organisation non gouvernemental (ONG),Innovation; Clean Tech; Climate Change; Storage; Renewables; Environment,Innovation; Les technologies propres; Chandements climatiques; Stockage d’énergie; Énergies renouvelables; L’environnement,Efficiency; Innovation; Petroleum,Efficiency; Innovation; Pétrolier,0,,0,

53,9-May-17,Idea/Idée,Canada well on its way to a renewable-energy future,,"This is an op-ed in the Globe And Mail (Dec 2016): http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/canada-well-on-its-way-to-a-renewable-energy-future/article33424984/ based on peer-reviewed/published research detailed here: http://wellbeing.ihsp.mcgill.ca/publications/2016RSER/   In 2016, renewable energy surpassed coal as the largest source of installed power capacity in the world. China’s carbon emissions peaked. The German upper house, the Bundesrat, voted to ban gasoline-powered cars by 2030. Vancouver chose to outlaw natural gas in new buildings by the same year. These are among the many signs the world is moving toward kicking its carbon habit, possibly by mid-century – a shift that would represent the simplest way to combat climate change. Canada faces a paradox in this regard. We are a large country with many resources, a small population and we already produce 10 per cent of the world’s hydro power, so you might think we could easily power ourselves with 100-per-cent renewable energy. On the other hand, most of our territory is not connected to electrical grids nor near population centres. In addition, we are energy hogs, in part owing to our need for heating and transportation that comes with a northern climate and dispersed population. So far, the deployments of hydro, solar and wind energy in Canada have been made in the highest-yielding locations. It is natural for the low-hanging fruit to be picked first. What is next? Now that Justin Trudeau’s government will ensure a uniform national carbon price, the question is, will it be just about tightening our belts or will it hasten a bountiful supply of renewable energy? This depends on an old puzzle in economics: Future renewable-power installations could either get cheaper, because we have learned from earlier practice and technology development, or they could get more expensive, since the best spots for steady wind, reliable solar and proximity to existing power distribution and population centres are already taken. To answer this, a student and I mapped each province’s remaining “low-hanging fruit” of renewables in the form of wind, solar, wave, tidal and some biomass energy. We compared this with total energy use, including electricity, transportation, heating and industrial production. The bottom line: There is plenty of renewable-energy potential near current roads, power lines and population centres. Most of it is wind power, with plenty of hydro and solar as well. In fact, every province except Alberta and Ontario has a large surfeit – enough to be choosy about siting installations to minimize environmental side-effects. Indeed, the boom and associated savings should be big enough to amply help workers and communities in transition. For instance, were Newfoundland to develop the easily accessible part of its truly enormous wind resources and to export the power, it would generate an annual income of $200,000 a household. While carbon pricing helps push this kind of investment, the market costs of building and of running wind and solar power are dropping, on their own, faster than policy is moving. That makes a shift to renewable power inevitable. By 2022, it will simply be cheaper to build and provide a gigawatt of wind power than the cheapest fossil-fuel alternative, and solar will be just behind. Because wind and solar are technologies, not fuels, their costs will continue to drop as time goes on. What about transportation, which still relies on liquid fuels? Our analysis assumes nearly complete electrification, a recently fanciful idea that is now already in motion. Electric cars have numerous advantages and are transforming the market faster than hybrids did. They say if you want to know what the future will be like, you should look at what investments are being made today. Judging by the accelerating rate of private-sector wind and solar investment here and elsewhere, it seems for Canada this trend is unlikely to stop until all our energy needs are met by clean electricity.",,Academia or education,Académie ou éducation,Renewables,Énergies renouvelables,Communities; Natural Gas; Electricity; Energy Efficiency; Renewables,Commuautés; Gaz Naturel; Électricité; Efficacité énergétique; Énergies renouvelables,4,,0,

Because people do not know that, in many applications, radiant heating can reduce energy costs by 30 per cent or more with equal comfort.” In 2002, the final report on Annex 37 of the International Energy Agency’s Energy Conservation in Buildings and Community Systems Program stated that radiant delivery optimizes thermal comfort in our built environment, with the least use of exergy, the quality aspect of energy.  That report pointed out that the models we use to predict energy use in buildings ignore the quality aspect of energy. … today calculations of energy use in buildings are based solely on the energy conservation principle, the first law of thermodynamics… the method of exergy analyses based on the first and second law of thermodynamics is presented, as the missing link needed to fill the gap in understanding and designing energy flows in buildings.

57,11-May-17,Idea/Idée,We need more than one energy customer,,"Currently we export almost all of our energy resources to one customer, the United States. The vast majority of Canada's pipelines lead to the central united states where we receive less for Canadian oil and natural gas than we would receive on the open market.  In addition to that Canadians on the East Coast and in Quebec import foreign oil for their daily needs. We currently can't even get Canadian oil to other Canadians who instead rely on oil from countries like Iraq, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. How is that sustainable if we look to the future of Canadian energy and what we want to leave the next generation with?  And when we talk about the next generation we have to realize that currently the private sector is willing to invest tens of billions into new Canadian pipelines that will make our country stronger, rely on foreign oil producers less and reduce our reliance on only one energy customer - the United States. According to the IEA and virtually everyone who studies the energy industry the world needs more oil and gas in the future as more people lift themselves out of poverty and rely on more things that oil and gas makes possible - like cars, computers, plastic, health care, farming equipment, travel etc.  This gives us two challenges. First the world will need more oil and gas, and it would be responsible to deliver more Canadian oil and gas to the world as Canada is simply a more environmentally and socially responsible place to develop oil and gas. If you don't agree, look up the countries with the ten largest oil reserves in the world and realize that this is a resource that according to virtually all experts we will continue to need more of in the future. However, with our current pipeline capacity we only deliver oil and gas to the United States. We hurt ourselves and others by making that possible, and currently the private sector is willing to invest 100% on expanding Canadian infrastructure to change this.  The second challenge is that we can't even provide oil and gas to Canadians in a world that is going to need more and more oil and gas in the future. In the future this will hurt consumers in the East and make Canada reliant on foreign oil producers who, unless this changes in the future, don't value things like democracy, minority rights or the same level of environmental protection we expect here. Do we want the next generation to be reliant on countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuala, or would we prefer that Canadians everywhere be able to receive Canadian oil and gas. And remember - the private sector is willing to make energy infrastructure like pipelines possible without cost to the taxpayers and they're willing to do it by Canadian standards which are some of the most environmentally sound in the world.  So let's leave the next generation with a better energy picture than we have today. Exporting 90+% of our energy products only to the United States is not good today and will likely be worse years from now. Further, forcing eastern Canada to rely on foreign imports isn't good today and won't be good tomorrow. Make the next generation of Canadian business better tomorrow by allowing infrastructure to be built today. ",,Employed in the energy industry,Les personnes employee par l’industrie énergie,Crude Oil; Pipelines; Transport; Markets; Environment,Pétrole brut; Pipelines; Transports; Marché du travail; L’environnement,"Pipelines, Security; Petroleum; International; Natural Gas; Finance","Pipelines, Sûreté; Pétrolier; Internationale; Gaz Naturel; La finance",41,,0,

Not only are we sending our money overseas to countries that do not consider the environment or minority rights to be a priority, we are also robbing ourselves of the royalties, tax revenues, and private-sector investment that would come with using Canadian oil instead of purchasing it from overseas. I appreciate the desire to stop pipelines from being built to protect the environent as well as to force Canadian oil & gas companies to ""keep it in the ground"", but the end result is counterproductive. More oil is shipped by rail (more dangerous and worse for the environment), and less clean Canadian natural gas is exported to replace carbon-intensive coal plants around the world.

The solution is to reduce the amount of oil we transport until we reach the necessary emission targets in 2020, '50 etc. I've read recently that we must leave most of our oil reserves unexploited and that we have more then enough for our needs already.

For decades man has aspired to build a perpetual motion machine, applying this concept to the gas industry just might not only lead to gas companies survival but their expansion. as wellTo explain. When fossil fuel are burned the carbon portion is converted to Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and released into the atmosphere. Today many companies, including giants such as GE, Shell, Chervon and NRG Energy are working of technologies that will not only capture CO2 at the source of it's production but are working on ways to pull CO2 directly out of the atmosphere. Which brings up back to perpetual motion. Before it's buy out by GE, Alstom Power was working with a small Canadian company Mantra Venture Group. Together they developed a process to covert CO2 to syn-gas using only renewable energy (Solar, Wind) and water. Syn-gas then could be converted to diesel fuel. providing an endless supply to gas companies, while at the same time creating a carbon neutral impact by the gas companies.

These people certainly can't afford clean energy either. My suggesting is to shift the focus from carbon taxes on individuals to regulations on industries to carry out their business using clean energy, whether it be by hydroelectricity, wind power, solar panels, or other means that don't include fossil fuel use. A regulation for big industries could be put in place to require them to have say 10% of their energy used for production be clean energy by 2022 or so, with increasing requirements until carbon neutral or even carbon positive is achieved. I suggest that you make a regulation of this sort not incentive based, as that indicates it is voluntary, but required. Our environment is important and inidivduals cannot hope to fix the issues when they aren't the leading contributor. In addition, if you're looking for other ideas on how the government may want to improve their management of climate change, there are several European countries that have achieved carbon neutrality and you can look to them for direction and ideas for improvement.",,Government,Gouvernement,Bioenergy,Bioénergie,Efficiency; Renewables; Hydro; Wind; Solar; Petroleum,Efficiency; Énergies renouvelables; Hydroélectricité; Éolienne; Solaire; Pétrolier,0,,0,

60,2-Jun-17,Idea/Idée,"Obstructed roadways, traffic jams",,"Honestly, anyone who thinks they're solving any problems on Toronto's roads by what they're doing is entirely mistaken.   There is RARELY anybody working when I pass a construction site on the roadways, and believe you me I have time to closely inspect the site for any sign of action due to the ridiculously slow speeds i am forced to trudge along at.  I mean it gives me lots of opportunity to familiarize myself with my surroundings, and sites are constantly, consistently, NORMALLY absolutely deserted.  It has occurred to me, passing these sites, that myself and my fellow road mates could even very well be a part of a social experiment, due to the pointlessness of the herding while nothing is being done and perfectly good road is literally right there...  Also I think, ""what a cash grab!!!""   I realize my digression however I feel it is necessary to accentuate my ultimate point.   I suggest that any work being proposed being done on the roads (or anything that may obstruct the roads) be approved by an environmental department due to the HOURS of extra drive time added to hapless commuters.  I think the government could make a lot of money charging for the carbon tax that the construction causes added to the bid.  You would need people to analyze how much extra carbon will be caused based on current traffic.  This might also encourage the crews to be out of the way during ""peak times"" thereby reducing their ultimate tax and also will reduce the actual extra carbon being expelled by having cars on the roads longer than they ought to be.   On that same vein, I would propose the same for company trucks on the public roads.  That should they choose to operate during peak hours, they be charged extra carbon taxes due to their clogging the roads with their inability to get up to speed and slow down fast enough to deal with traffic.  I believe this will encourage them to operate outside of peak hours.   I can't say about the busses though as people need them so much, however I believe once drivers dont have so many other frustrating obstructions to deal with on the roadways, the busses will be able to find their harmony with the rest of the traffic.   Let us take a moment to regard the city's cab drivers, who are constantly obstructing the traffic.  These city streets are paid for by taxes and do not belong to them, yet I'm constantly forced to maneuver around them stopped in no stopping zones for instance among other disregards for traffic rules.  I believe as an organization who operates on our streets they should be a shining example of the rules or be penalized more than the average driver.  I believe police could find much revenue by cracking down on the cab drivers driving infractions, especially considering they are constantly and unsafely using laptops and cellphones while they drive.  Also, this will reduce carbon emissions by ensuring an obstruction free commute.   I think the implications of such a venture are actually quite exciting.  To consider how many analysts, accountants and engineers (just to name a few professions) that would be required can only mean we will need to educate ourselves and our children to be able to efficiently tackle the issue at hand, and that can only make our population more effective at tackling even more pressing issues!!!    ",,General public,Public générale,Climate Change,Chandements climatiques,Transportation; Communities; Finance,Transports; Commuautés; La finance,0,,0,

I also work in a bike store and meet lots of people who have thought about commuting by bike, or do so already. However, both from my own experiences and from what I hear from others, cycling is often dangerous and terrifying. This is partially due to lack of knowledge of the rules of the road on behalf of both the driver and the cyclists, and a mutual frustration between them. However, cycling to work or school can greatly reduce the number of cars in the road, and the environmental impacts of driving. Bikes don't use gas, the cause less damage to the roads, and they make us healthier at the same time! They're also often faster. However, many people are reluctant to commute by bike due to the dangers posed by drivers, especially during rush hour. Increasing the number of bike paths (and preferably well designed, and separated bike lanes from the road), as well as awareness and education for both cyclists and drivers about bike laws could all help make the roads feel safer and encourage more people to ride their bikes! ",,General public,Public générale,Energy Efficiency; Climate Change,Efficacité énergétique; Chandements climatiques,Transportation; Communities,Transports; Commuautés,10,,0,

60,3-Jun-17,Idea/Idée,nanoFlowcell and bi-ION liquid,,"While we should do everything we can to move our country toward small (micro) and large scale natural renewable energy, like solar, geothermal and vertical-axis wind energy, we should also be looking for ways to completely replace all fossil fuels ASAP. One way to do that would be with an alternative energy medium which could easily be implemented using current carbon energy infrastructure for fast deployment. There are research teams worldwide who are working on such problems and some who have solutions already, like nanoFlowcell. That group/research team has invented a flow cell technology and liquid electrolyte combination that could replace most modern energy generation systems like combustion engines and power stations in a safe, environmentally-friendly and non-toxic way. Their prototype car for example can drive 1,400km on a single tank of bi-ION liquid, which carries the energy needed for the flow cell to create low-voltage electricity to move the car. This technology can be scaled up to public transport and more importantly to power generation stations, which would mean cutting the carbon problem at the source if we could replace all our electricity generation needs to this system. Another positive point is that the ionic liquid can be produced locally in an environmentally compatible way and is not hazardous to health, thus creating or replacing obsolete (carbon) jobs in the energy sector. Now, this is just information I have come across in my personal research into alternative energies as an individual and I am in no way associated with nanoFlowcell or any parent company or individuals associated with it. (Learn about their technology for yourselves on their website) I just think it is a great applicable concept that could be a game changer for Canada's energy needs. It is also an opportunity to introduce cheaper energy to Canadians, because this liquid would be much less expensive to produce than fossil fuels, especially the dirty tar sands. It would also be important that the savings from such energy generation be passed down to Canadians and be kept out of the hands of corporations so that the introduction of such alternative energy could be used as a one-two punch to alleviate environmental AND economic stress for everyone. I believe this idea should be seriously explored by NRCan, does anyone else think similarly?

This, even though we were told that industrial properties in our area were already using the same type of equipment on a larger scale.

'technology has been sitting on a lab bench since 2014 waiting for funding from the Canadian government, to move the technology from the lab to commercialization. At one time (2014), Canada was inline to be the first country to build a pilot plant to convert CO2 to saleable chemicals at the Lafarge Cement Plant in Richmond BC. Today, do to non action by the Canadian government, economic and environmental advantages are being lost by Canadians to other countries. From Zurich ""This Machine Just Started Sucking CO2 Our Of The Air To Save Us From Climate Change"" https://www.fastcompany.com/40421871/this-machine-just-started-sucking-co2-out-of-the-air-to-save-us-from-climate-change ""Mantra’s ERC technology employs an electrochemical reactor to convert carbon dioxide, the most notorious greenhouse gas, into valuable products. By doing so, large stationary emitters, such as cement or power plants, can profitably reduce CO2 emissions by generating a valuable, salable chemical. Chemicals that can be produced from CO2 using ERC include formic acid and its salts, carbon monoxide (used to make syn-gas which in turned  is used to make diesel fuel)"" Mantra Energy' technology is market ready.Per MVTG 10Q Converting C02 to ""formate salts have been obtained on tin cathodes with current efficiencies above 80%, at industrially relevant conditions. Current efficiencies exceeding 80% have also been obtained on proprietary silver cathodes for carbon monoxide, the key constituent of syngas."" Potential economic opportunities from CO2 converted products being missed by Canadian citizens, per MVTG 10Q. Syngas :""the ERC process to syngas suffers from very few market limitations. The market for synthetic gas is currently estimated at around $36 billion, and growing. Due to the large number of products which can be produced from syngas, including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel or methanol, we anticipate the demand for an environmentally-conscious pathway to these chemicals will grow rapidly into the future"". Formates:""These products have existing markets as commodity chemicals and sell for between $1,000 and $1,500 per tonne, with global consumption being in excess of 600,000 tonnes per year. Formic acid and its salts are used in a variety of industrial applications, including silage preservation, leather tanning, textiles production, oil well drilling, and de-icing, and show enormous potential for market expansion through their use in chemical energy storage"" As more efficient cathodes are being developed for other saleable chemicals  (example methanol), economic rewards to Canadians will only increase. Environmentally, by MEA technology remaining in the lab, Canadian businesses that produce wasteful CO2 are missing the opportunity to neutralizing their Carbon imprint.. So Canada I leave you with this question. Is it worth a 3 to 5 million investment to bring in 10's of billions of dollars of economic wealth to Canada, while at the same time making Canadian companies carbon neutral? Canada is a leader not a follower.

I suggest, because its 2017, our 150 birthday, that we convert our wonderful 1967 Centennial flame, in front of Canadas’ parliament, to be powered with green energy sourced hydrogen gas, instead of the current hydro-carbon based natural gas system. This would go along way to communicate to all those concerned that we are all serious about transitioning our economy to clean energy production, storage and transport. Hydrogen based technologies currently exist to power the flame safely and sustainably. Green sources of energy can produce the needed hydrogen for combustion as well as many other applications via hydrogen fuel cells. Many economies, Sweden for example, are committing aggressively to this green economy transition. I think, and I suspect many others will welcome this opportunity to help create a symbol of change in front of our House of Commons representing all Canadians. Everyone can agree that we want a clean and sustainable energy future. This is one small, easily achievable gesture with many long-term benefits;  Signals our government policies affirm anthropogenic induced climate change is real Supports innovation for transitioning to a green economy Powerful clean energy solutions are available We can provide global leadership in climate change  Please take the time to consult the scientific and technical expertise to make this happen.

That excess power sometimes close to 2GW's is often dumbed into the US markets.  Li-ion grid storage batteries would completely transform the Ontario power market and allow firm power to be sold at a much higher rate to neighbouring jurisdictions. Problem grid storage is hard for private companies to find funding, due to the hard to model revenue model associated with storage. If the Canadian federal government purchased the storage, it can easily be sited on Canadian military bases across the province and even country. It would provide the bases with back-up power in case of emergency. The USA deploys billions of dollars worth of renewable energy across their military bases around the world. Allowing Canada to include these under our defence budget and help us meet our NATO spending commitments. This idea has the potential to dramatically reduce power costs across the province and deploy more wind and solar. And make Ontario more competitive.  Batteries instead of bombs.

Everybody should have the right use the grid and self procure their own green energy, and reduce their carbon footprint.

A province of Oil profit and Oil jobs, the political parties are noticable biased toward Oil profit, Nalcor, Hydro and other big business in province. Our energy costs are high and getting higher by the day. The way government has choose to run the electrical utilities is extremely incompetent. The contracts run amok with huge salaries, continuances, severances and such with very little review or supervision. What is worst is until very recently they squashed all independent development and interest in renewable personal energy sources such as Windmills and Solar. We can't feed excessive energy to the grid as some provinces can and considering we had blackouts in our coldest months and warnings against power usage at peak season and a general strain on an old faltering system through Newfoundland Power and Newfoundland Hydro who share a Monopoly divided by region. There is no other choice but to use this inefficient, failing, expensive and non environment friendly source of Energy. There are many rebates for home heating insulation, power cost cutting measures, but very little to promote renewable clean energies. Nor will the province seem to investigate more reasonable money saving and cost cutting green energy now that it's contracted muskrat falls The gross misuse of government funding and oversight through political biased and manipulation is highly affecting not only the common person and their bill but also visably destroying our environment.  We need to put into action windmill operations in our windiest province and encourage personal renewable energies through pay back credit on the grid and tax benefits and encouragement for entrepreneurs and business to bring in renewable energy projects, and materials. And especially offer the course of study at once of the provinces secondary education facilities. We can change where we make our money and improve the environment while creating jobs and more educated individuals. The skills can be changed over.  The courses and diplomas can be created.

The affordability and reliability of energy supply is, and will continue to be, of great concern for Canadians (especially given our extreme weather conditions across the country!). There are indeed tremendous opportunities to deploy wind and other distributed generation technologies across the nation. For instance, as coal generation continues to be phased out (in Alberta particularly), it will hopefully be replaced by renewables. However, government action, as you point out, is required to incentivize renewables and to put a price tag on the pollution emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels. That’s why, in December 2016, the federal, provincial, and territorial governments, working with Indigenous partners, adopted the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change.","Merci d’avoir contribué à la discussion.

60,22-Jun-17,Idea/Idée,Replace Fossil Fuels and Uranium with Thorium,,"Thorium is considered the ""most abundant, most readily available, cleanest, and safest energy source on Earth,"" science writer Richard Martin. Thorium-based nuclear power is nuclear reactor-based, fuelled primarily by the nuclear fission of the isotope uranium-233 produced from the fertile element thorium. According to proponents, a thorium fuel cycle offers several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle—including much greater abundance on Earth, superior physical and nuclear fuel properties, and reduced nuclear waste production. Some believe thorium is key to developing a new generation of cleaner, safer nuclear power. According to an opinion piece by a group of scientists at the Georgia Institute of Technology, considering its overall potential, thorium-based power ""can mean a 1000+ year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly sustainable energy sources solving a huge portion of mankind’s negative environmental impact."" After studying the feasibility of using thorium, nuclear scientists Ralph W. Moir and Edward Teller suggested that thorium nuclear research should be restarted after a three-decade shutdown and that a small prototype plant should be built. The World Nuclear Association explains some of the possible benefits:  Thorium is three times as abundant as uranium and nearly as abundant as lead and gallium in the Earth's crust. The Thorium Energy Alliance estimates ""there is enough thorium in the United States alone to power the country at its current energy level for over 1,000 years.” Almost all thorium is fertile Th-232, compared to uranium that is composed of 99.3% fertile U-238 and 0.7% more valuable fissile U-235. Canadian CANDU reactors are capable of using thorium. It is very difficult to make a practical nuclear bomb from a thorium reactor's by-products. There is much less nuclear waste—up to two orders of magnitude less, states Moir and Teller, eliminating the need for large-scale or long-term storage; ""Chinese scientists claim that hazardous waste will be a thousand times less than with uranium."" The radioactivity of the resulting waste also drops down to safe levels after just a few hundred years, compared to tens of thousands of years needed for current nuclear waste to cool off. According to Moir and Teller, ""once started up it needs no other fuel except thorium because it makes most or all of its own fuel."" This only applies to breeding reactors, which produce at least as much fissile material as they consume. Thorium fuel cycle is a potential way to produce long term nuclear energy with low radio-toxicity waste. In addition, the transition to thorium could be done through the incineration of weapons grade plutonium (WPu) or civilian plutonium. Since all natural thorium can be used as fuel no expensive fuel enrichment is needed. Comparing the amount of thorium needed with coal, Nobel laureate Carlo Rubbia of CERN, (European Organization for Nuclear Research), estimates that one ton of thorium can produce as much energy as 200 tons of uranium, or 3,500,000 tons of coal. Liquid fluoride thorium reactors are designed to be meltdown proof. A plug at the bottom of the reactor melts in the event of a power failure or if temperatures exceed a set limit, draining the fuel into an underground tank for safe storage.  Mining thorium is safer and more efficient than mining uranium. Thorium's ore monazite generally contains higher concentrations of thorium than the percentage of uranium found in its respective ore. This makes thorium a more cost efficient and less environmentally damaging fuel source. Thorium mining is also easier and less dangerous than uranium mining, as the mine is an open pit which requires no ventilation, unlike underground uranium mines, where radon levels can be potentially harmful.   I do support green energy such as wind, solar, geo-thermal, tidal etc. This could be part of an integrated energy network that includes all non-fossil fuels and bring us to zero carbon without any power interruptions or supply/demand issues.",,Academia or education,Académie ou éducation,,,Nuclear,Énergie Nucléaire,17,,0,

As an Albertan you should know that Southern Alberta has the best sun in Canada. Opportunity is there to produce your own energy cheaper than this from the grid and even make your own money (check ViZn battery vendor offer). Coal is not good but still over 90% of Alberta energy comes from fossil fuel. This is not only about CO2 but also about all of the other harmful heavy metal particles emitted. The idea of solar panels/shingles on every roof is great. We will not use your tax dollars.

However antiquated legislation, such as steam boiler staffing regulations not seen in Europe for years, craters the economics of many small power projects. In Ontario these regulations even halt utilisation of Italian ORC technology, even though this technology does not operate with steam. There is too much emphasis on large power, such as the concept to run expensive hydro lines to northern Ontario. Currently many of these communities run diesel engines for heat and power. A much more eloquent solution is to develop renewable pyrolysis oil plants in the North using local biomass as a feedstock, and providing permanents jobs for locals. The pyrolysis oil would then fuel diesels or turbines for power.       ",,Industry or Business,Industrie ou entreprise,Innovation; Heating/cooling; Heat; Energy Efficiency; Retrofit; Net-zero; Homes; Buildings; Industry; Climate Change; Indigenous; Environment,Innovation; Le chauffage et le refroidissement; Heat; Efficacité énergétique; Retrofit; Nette zéro ; Maisons; Bâtiments; Industrie; Chandements climatiques; Autochtone; L’environnement,Renewables; Biomass; Remote Communities,Énergies renouvelables; Biomasse; Les collectivités éloignées,5,,1,

When I was a kid, we had big maple trees on the south side of my house. I would walk around comfortably in jeans in my house and the area close to it, not realizing that it was actually blistering hot out.  According to a researcher from l'Université du Québec en Outaouais, one can measure a 17-degree difference between two locations that are only 500 metres apart--because the cooler place has trees.

Depending on the size and type of tree you plant, a tree can cost as little as a few dollars to less than two hundred to plant. Trees can go without any maintenance for decades, but planting them could also generate jobs for arborists (who know how to trim and take care of them properly) and landscape designers, both of whom should be required to play a role in the design phase of the built environment.

This new technology takes compressed air and stores it in large underwater balloons at the bottom of Lake Ontario. When energy is needed, the balloons are deflated forcing the air back out through turbines to generate power.    Hydrostor began construction of the prototype Hydrostor Station on Toronto Island back in 2015 and it is the world’s first-ever underwater compressed air energy storage system. It took several years to design and build the underwater storage unit and onshore energy conversion system. During times of higher demand, the weight of the water against the balloons forces the air back to the surface through a large pipe and an expander converts it back into electricity. The station is expected to improve power quality for Toronto Island residents during the performance-testing period.   The storage system has a capacity of 660 KW, enough to power approximately 330 homes at peak output and the system can run for about an hour. With this system, requirements for backup diesel and natural gas capacity for Island residents are lower and Hydrostor claims the balloon system is about half the cost of storage batteries and can last twice as long.   What do you think of this new innovative technology? Sound off in the comments below!   ","Alors que la demande en matière d’électricité renouvelable et propre continue d’augmenter, la société canadienne Hydrostor prend les devants avec un concept innovateur en matière de stockage d’énergie pour aider à pallier le caractère intermittent de l’énergie éolienne et solaire.   Cette nouvelle technologie comprime l’air et le stocke dans de gros ballons immergés dans les profondeurs du lac Ontario. Lorsque la demande est élevée, le poids de l’eau qui pèse sur les ballons est utilisé pour retourner l’air à la surface par un gros conduit, puis un détendeur le convertit en électricité.   L’entreprise a commencé la construction de son prototype de station Hydrostor sur l’île de Toronto en 2015. Cette installation est le premier système au monde de stockage d’énergie sous forme d’air comprimé sous l’eau. On prévoit que la station améliorera la qualité de l’alimentation électrique pour les résidents de l’endroit au cours de la période d’essai de performance.   Doté d’une capacité de 660 kW, soit assez pour alimenter en électricité 330 foyers, le système de stockage en ballons fonctionne pendant environ une heure et réduit de beaucoup la dépendance des résidents de l’île aux réserves de gaz naturel et de diesel.

60,2-Aug-17,Idea/Idée,Solar on the Roof / Le solaire sur le toit,,"On Tesla’s website, you’ll find their vision of the homes of the future, distinctly styled, but all equipped with a Tesla electric vehicle, sleek battery packs adorning their walls and electricity generating solar roofs.   The panels that make Tesla’s solar roofs fall into their own category: Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV). BIPVs are any photovoltaic materials used as part of a building’s structure. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, in 2009, about 1% of solar installations were building-integrated. The company has been taking orders for their new solar photovoltaic roofs since early May in both Canada and the US, but do they stack up to the competition?   The bottom line is most important for consumers. Cost estimates for Tesla Roofs according to consumer reports for three US states are below:       House location   Square footage of Tesla roof   … of which with solar cells (sq ft)   Cost of Tesla roof (US$)   Electricity savings over 30 years (US$)     New York   1,175   820   $38,400   $46,800     Texas   3,215   1,600   $85,200   $60,200     California   1,875   940   $49,200   $84,700     *Note: Only 50 to 70% of the roof is fitted with solar cells.   Rough Estimates for installed regular solar voltaic panels in Texas can give us a comparison. A best-case solar energy generation scenario (12,500 watt system) as calculated using the NREL PVWatts calculator, the system would cost around $42,000. On a strict power generation, cost comparison there is no competition.   Accounting for the cost of a new roof makes this better (as the Tesla installation is an entirely new roof). Using roofing installation costs as our guide a 3,215 sq foot roof would be around $30,000, which would make the Tesla premium around $13,000.   Bringing this to Canada, at this time Ontario accounts for 90% of solar electricity generation in Canada. This is primarily due to the provincial Feed In Tariff subsidy (FIT) which was introduced in 2009. With FIT, utilities have been required to purchase solar electricity at a price higher than that of retail rates (FIT rate in 2009: $0.80 per kWh, FIT rate in 2017: about $0.3per kWh). The contracts are for 20 years.   The Texas home in Ontario would generate income around US$2,800 per year (pre-tax). Enough to pay back the Tesla roof in about thirty years. With Tesla’s solar cells having a 30-year warranty, this essentially results in a free roof.     Although the above cost analysis is rough, the Tesla solar roof is unlikely to become the go-to solar product for most residential homeowners. However, in areas with high electricity prices and government subsidies, it is an attractive roofing option that can pay for itself.   What do you think? Do the Tesla roofs look like an option for you to offset some of your personal energy costs?  "," Le site Web de Tesla nous livre la vision de cette société pour les maisons du futur, chacune avec son style, mais toutes avec un véhicule électrique de marque Tesla, des blocs-batteries aux murs qui s’intègrent bien au décor et des toits solaires produisant de l’électricité.   Les panneaux qui forment les toits solaires Tesla relèvent de la technologie photovoltaïque intégrée au bâtiment, qui comprend tout matériel photovoltaïque utilisé dans la charpente d’un bâtiment. D’après le National Renewable Energy Laboratory des États-Unis, en 2009 environ 1 % des installations solaires étaient intégrées aux bâtiments. La société a commencé à prendre les commandes pour ses nouveaux toits solaires photovoltaïques en mai au Canada et aux États-Unis, mais son produit est-il concurrentiel?   Le bénéfice net est ce qui importe le plus aux consommateurs. Voici l’estimation du coût d’un toit Tesla selon le constat de consommateurs dans trois États américains :       Domicile   Superficie en pi2 du toit Tesla   ... dont, pour les cellules solaires (pi2)   Coût du toit Tesla ($ US)   Économies en frais d’électricité sur 30 ans ($ US)     New York   1 175   820   38 400 $   46 800 $     Texas   3 215   1 600   85 200 $   60 200 $     Californie   1 875   940   49 200 $   84 700 $     *Nota : Seulement 50 à 70 % du toit est composé de cellules solaires.   Des estimations approximatives relativement à une installation ordinaire de panneaux solaires voltaïques au Texas nous donnent un point de comparaison. Dans un scénario de production d’énergie solaire optimal (système de 12 500 W), un tel système, selon le calculateur de NREL PVWatts, coûte environ 42 000 $. Du strict point de vue de la production d’énergie, il n’y a pas de comparaison.   Cependant, si l’on fait entrer en compte le coût d’un nouveau toit, la comparaison devient moins désavantageuse pour Tesla (puisque Tesla installe un tout nouveau toit). Le coût d’installation d’un toit de 3 215 pi2 s’élevant à environ 30 000 $, le supplément pour le produit Tesla n’est plus que de 13 000 $ approximativement.   Voyons ce qu’il en serait au Canada. C’est l’Ontario qui produit actuellement 90 % de l’électricité solaire au pays. Ce pourcentage est principalement attribuable au programme Tarifs de rachat garantis (FIT), lancé en 2009. Dans le cadre de ce programme, les services publics doivent payer l’électricité solaire à un prix plus élevé que les tarifs au détail (tarif FIT par kWh en 2009 : 0,80 $; en 2017 : environ 0,30 $). Les contrats sont d’une durée de 20 ans.   En Ontario, notre maison du Texas avec son toit Tesla produirait un revenu d’environ 2 800 $ US par année (avant impôts), soit assez pour rembourser le toit Tesla en 30 ans environ. Comme les cellules solaires de Tesla ont une garantie de 30 ans, le toit serait donc pour ainsi dire gratuit.   Cette analyse de coût est approximative, mais il est peu probable que le toit solaire Tesla devienne le produit solaire incontournable pour la majorité des propriétaires résidentiels. Toutefois, dans les régions où le prix de l’électricité est élevé et où des subventions gouvernementales sont offertes, l’option devient alléchante et pourrait être rentable.   Qu’en pensez-vous? Est-ce que les toits Tesla vous paraissent une option qui vous permettrait de compenser une partie de vos frais d’énergie?",Youth ,,Electricity; Industry; Climate Change; Indigenous; Renewables,Électricité; Industrie; Chandements climatiques; Autochtone; Énergies renouvelables,Transportation; Storage; Electricity; Renewables; Storage; Affordability,Transports; Stockage d’énergie; Électricité; Énergies renouvelables; Stockage d’énergie; Abordabilité,7,,0,

Hemp cellulose can be extracted and used to make cellophane, rayon, celluloid and a range of related plastics. Hemp is known to contain around and is considered a good source (wood contains around 40%, flax 65-75%, and cotton up to 90%) that has particular promise due to its relative sustainability and low environmental impact.  Hempcrete can replace cement in building and construction.   It is a fibre reinforced lightweight concrete; hemp hurd and fiber, lime, sand, clay, 2% cement. Process: mixed and poured into forms, then plastered with our proprietary natural plaster and finally, coloured with mineral pigments. The bio-composite material stores energy quickly and then releases it in response to a room’s fluctuations in temperatures. The high-efficiency envelope thermal mass hemp walls “breathe” and regulate moisture      In any contaminated soil, hemp also actively absorbs heavy-metal contaminants from soil, gradually purifying the earth.   Building homes with hemp is one of the most promising applications of hemp. There’s several benefits that hempcrete offers. First, it acts an amazing thermodynamic insulator, so it helps to reduce the energy costs by 50–70% annually for families (especially those in extremely cold or hot climates). Hempcrete is also great for those who are sensitive to allergies. Regular insulators and paint can be the prime source of allergies for many people, as these conventional materials can be toxic. Made with all natural material, can eliminate many different health problems. Hempcrete also continuously absorbs CO2 as it ages, so it reduces your carbon footprint. As it absorbs CO2, the material actually becomes stronger. Essentially, a building made with hempcrete will become stronger over time. When it comes to construction, hempcrete homes have zero construction waste. When you consider that 55% of the world’s energy consumption is construction-waste related, there are huge implications on reducing our carbon footprint. Other applications of hemp for homes are soundproof hemp walls and bash-proof hemp roofing.   Hemp fabric has proved to be superior to its counterparts in almost every way. Hemp fiber is more…  Porous and breathable – Hemp fibers allow your skin to breathe. Durable – Hemp fiber is the most durable fiber of any plant. Eco-friendly & Sustainable – Cotton is a water-intensive crop and uses 25% of the world’s pesticides. Hemp requires 50% less water to grow than cotton and requires no use of pesticides.  In 1941, Henry Ford built a car out of hemp. It was not only built out of hemp plastic, but it also ran on hemp fuel. Hemp plastic was tested to be much stronger than steel. They tried denting the hemp car with a hammer, but the car didn’t even budge.  Hemp can be used as a biofuel.  An acre of hemp can produce power equivalent to a thousand gallons of gasoline. Imagine the sustainability benefits that would bring. Hemp can be used for office supplies and chairs/desks. It is a great substitute for wood and paper.  Hemp could also replace plastic bags and plastic packaging.  Currently, plastic waste is killing our wildlife and environment.      http://www.hempcrete.ca/what-is-hempcrete/ https://ministryofhemp.com/blog/hemp-products-list/  ",,Academia or education,Académie ou éducation,Solar; Geothermal; Innovation; Heating/cooling; Energy Efficiency; Retrofit; Net-zero; Homes; Clean Tech,Solaire; Géothermie; Innovation; Le chauffage et le refroidissement; Efficacité énergétique; Retrofit; Nette zéro ; Maisons; Les technologies propres,Efficiency; Renewables; Biomass,Efficiency; Énergies renouvelables; Biomasse,1,,0,

60,11-Aug-17,Idea/Idée,Redouble Efforts to Eliminate Fossil Fuel Industry Subsidies,,"About CCL Canada: Citizens’ Climate Lobby is a non-profit, non-partisan, grassroots advocacy organization creating the political will for a livable planet. Since September 2010, our volunteer members have been lobbying their MPs for a carbon fee and dividend proposal which includes the following clause: “All existing subsidies of fossil fuels including tax credits shall be phased out over the five years following enactment [of a carbon price].” Appreciation: We are thankful that Canadians now have a nationally-coordinated carbon pricing policy and have embarked in earnest on a 35-year transition towards creating an energy system that will be almost 100% fossil fuel free by 2050. We acknowledge that Canada’s long-term prosperity is dependent on the sustainable use of our natural resources. We understand that extraction industries see a need for preferential tax treatment to countervail their high capital requirements and long timescales. We appreciate recent actions to evolve these provisions:  Certain types of wells are being reclassified from Canadian Exploration Expenses (CEE) to Canadian Development Expenses (CDE) in the 2017 budget. The Accelerated Capital Cost Allowances (ACCAs) for oil sands expired in 2015 and coal expires in 2020. ACCAs remain available for renewable projects, and the 2017 budget opens a geothermal category. The Clean Energy Fund has made Canada a world leader in Carbon Capture and Storage technology. The recently expanded Northern Responsible Energy Approach for Community Heat and Electricity Program.  Prime Minister’s Mandate Letters: Natural Resources Minister Carr has been mandated to work with Finance Minister Morneau to: “explore opportunities to enhance existing tax measures to generate more clean technology investments and engage with provinces and territories to make Canada the world’s most competitive tax jurisdiction for investments in the research, development and manufacturing of clean technology.” Finance Minister Morneau has also been mandated to: “fulfill our G20 commitment and phase out subsidies for the fossil fuel industry over the medium-term” This directly impacts Natural Resources Canada. Our key concerns: Canadians accepted some targeted subsidies as the necessary price of prosperity and good jobs in the past. However, future production of our fossil fuel reserves will be constrained by the world’s carbon budget, and continued subsidies will provide diminishing returns. It no longer makes sense to buttress the fossil fuel sector against the tide of history. There is an urgent need to reconsider the fossil fuel industry's economic value chain in light of climate change. Negative taxes are artificially incentivizing companies to sink costs into infrastructure with dubious prospects. The costs of orphaned wells, tailing ponds, climate disruptions, and other externalities will be borne by future taxpayers long after fossil fuels have ceased to generate wealth. Climate change is a game changer. Support for outdated policies can carry opportunity costs as well. Without smart new policy to build markets, unlock private finance, and secure innovation, our nation’s clean-technology sector will quickly fall behind – according to a recent study by Analytica Advisors. Development of new reserves in the Arctic is particularly risky given the Arctic’s fragile ecosystem and the industry’s questionable capacity to clean up oil spills. We applaud the ban on new offshore permits but wonder about the risks from pre-existing permits and leases. Our Requests:  We request a redoubling of efforts to eliminate subsidies to the fossil fuel industry:  Re-examine the fossil fuel value chain to see where incentives can be modified to wind down the sector in an orderly and expedient manner. Grant the Auditor General access to all analyses. Define the “medium-term” timeline for phase outs. Analyze the macroeconomic consequences that stranded assets will have on the Canadian economy. Compare the jobs created by investments in fossil fuels versus clean energy technology. Itemize the environmental clean-up costs taxpayers will be responsible for when fossil fuels are obsolete. Reconsider the allowance rate for CDE. Phase out ACCA for liquefied natural gas projects.

60,11-Aug-17,Idea/Idée,Recommendation for a more comprehensive national carbon pricing policy ,,"Since September 2010, Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) Canada members have been lobbying their federal parliamentarians for carbon fee and dividend: a national, upstream, and incrementally rising carbon tax where 100 percent of the money is returned to citizens on an equitable basis in a cheque. On October 3, 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau announced Canada will have a national price on carbon. The carbon price starts at $10 per tonne in 2018 and rises to $50 per tonne in 2022. We applaud the 42nd Parliament for taking this step to secure a healthy climate for us and future generations. However, $50 per tonne won't be enough to meet Canada's goal of reducing emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Furthermore, our current goal is woefully inadequate to the challenge posed by climate change. If every country adopted Canada’s targets, this would not keep warming below 2oC, let alone the 1.5oC nations promised to pursue in Paris. In short, we are off to a great start, but must do better.     Our recommendations: CCL Canada recommends that the government adopt a modified version of its recently announced carbon pricing policy to ensure Canada’s carbon pricing is effective, fair, and stimulates our clean tech industry. An annually rising minimum fee past 2022 is an important step. The federal government must also provide clarity on the fee’s comprehensiveness. A fee applied at the wellhead and point of import in all provinces will most effectively reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions and send an economy-wide signal to invest in clean tech alternatives. A fee on some sectors and not others defeats its purpose, burdens some industries and not others and will undermine Canada’s climate commitments.   Additionally, a steadily rising fee will also require that revenue be returned to Canadians to protect those with low and middle incomes. Finally, a study by  Regional Economic Modeling Inc found that carbon fee revenue returned to people would stimulate local economies and most importantly reduce GHG emissions.   The simple steps needed:    That the carbon fee be applied upstream: at the wellhead, coal mine or point of entry into the economy.     That the national carbon price continue to rise past 2022 with the objective of Canada exceeding our Paris targets and becoming a world leader in tackling the climate crisis and in the clean tech industry.     Border tax adjustments must be included in the policy to level the playing field for domestic industries with international jurisdictions without a similar carbon price.     That the federal government work with the provinces and territories to ensure provincial carbon pricing systems can keep up with the rising federal minimum carbon price without imposing any additional burdens on low and middle income Canadians. For example, the federal government could propose fee and dividend as a model policy. This could help overcome some of the opposition faced in carbon-intensive regions such as Saskatchewan and Alberta as carbon fees continue to rise.     To ensure that there is a consistent policy towards combatting climate change, that the federal government, as promised in the 2015 election, end financial subsidies to fossil fuel companies.    CCL is grateful for the work of the government of Canada and for recognizing the myriad connections between the climate crisis and the many problems on Earth. It is 100% possible to begin to tackle many of these problems at one time with an effective carbon pricing policy and we are here to help you at this time of change.",,Community organization,Organization communautés,,,Finance; International; Governance,La finance; Internationale; Gouvernance,17,,0,

This kind of peak generation is extremely costly (try 2500% more costly, yes, thousand) and bears a heavy cost in carbon footprint as it typically always rely on fossil fueled power generation.  Renewables are great, but they provide energy, not power. This means that while they greatly contribute to the grid, they cannot be leveraged at will when demand increases beyond normal levels, say when temperatures dips way below zero.  IoT enables control in a secure and extremely cost-efficient manner, all the while providing the homeowner with a much clearer understanding of their energy use. But this is only true if such devices are not cheap consumer electronics made overseas, with no oversight on security, privacy, efficiency and most importantly, the end-user's comfort and well-being. Since Canada is leading in smart grid and DR research and commercialization, it would be only fitting it is the one to lead the way to proper standardization and certification of domestic equipment meant for integration with the utility power grid.

60,19-Sep-17,Idea/Idée,CGA Vision 2050,,"The Canadian Gas Association & it's members undertook a visioning exercise to consider what the natural gas delivery industry & its end-use consumers could look like in 2050.    CGA’s Vision 2050 focuses in on three key questions:  1.	What will a Canadian energy consumer look like in 2050? What energy mix and technologies could provide the necessary energy needs for consumers from industry to homeowners and businesses to the transportation and power generation system?  2.	What will the energy delivery industry itself look like in 2050? What will the ‘mix’ of energy look like in 2050, including how much of the energy in our pipelines will be natural gas, renewable natural gas (RNG), hydrogen, solar fuels/synthetic natural gas, or some other product, and what other technologies will be required to reduce the system’s & emissions profile & increase its efficiency?  3.	Are there key principles that should help guide all stakeholders? What are the high-level principles that should be in place to help guide the natural gas industry, governments and stakeholders when considering Canada’s energy future?   In discussing Canada’s energy future, many potential scenarios arise about both what society in general will look like as well as what the energy industry could evolve into.  A recent Environics poll indicated that between 2017 & 2050 Canada’s population growth rate will steadily decline, with more seniors than children, causing a shift away from single detached dwellings to a higher growth rate for high-rise apartments with more one & two-person households.  People will use the internet of things to manage most aspects of their lives from energy usage, to ordering groceries, to where & how they will work.  Canadians in 2050 will also be “totally connected” with more choices & options available to them around many aspects of their lives.  With these background thoughts our industry has attempted to understand what the world may look like in 2050 in the context of the questions above.   What will the energy consumer of the future look like?    •	“Totally connected” to the world around them, so readily able to access information on questions affecting their day to day well-being •	From that “total connectedness,” able to have a heightened awareness of the impacts of their day to day activities on the world around them – so more accessible by stakeholders like energy service providers •	Less in need of travel to connect for business, and possibly for other services, as more and more such things can come to the home •	Even more accustomed than today to instant access, and therefore even less tolerant of any interruptions of services •	Dependent on energy for more services, but probably requiring much less energy for any one service due to efficiencies •	Quite possibly even less well informed about where energy comes from as the quality & complexity of life increases in concert with people being further and further removed from the diversity of energy supply fueling that life.  •	Probably living in an even more urbanized society than today •	Probably living in a society where energy should be even more affordable than today (given that energy has consistently become more affordable over time) •	Probably otherwise just like the consumer of today: trying to support him/herself and a family, trying to make ends meet, trying to get more for less.  What will the energy delivery industry itself look like?  •	More integrated, total energy service providers; natural gas, electricity, transportation, etc., but not necessarily conventional utilities – they could be telecom, internet, automotive, energy producing, or other entities •	More choices for independent energy supply needs, with the development of more self-generation technology – meaning some changes in the regulated model •	More consolidation of existing players as rationalization and efficiencies occur amongst conventional players •	More entities playing in a range of markets – domestic and international - with a strong possibility of a significant presence by Canadian entities at the global level given their established bases (not unlike banking)  What are the key principles that could help guide all stakeholders?   •	An open thought process There can be no preconceived ideas when considering the optimal solutions for meeting energy needs in the context of economic and environmental and other priorities.  •	Government/industry cooperation An open policy and regulatory process that sets conditions rather than trying to set outcomes, allowing creativity in markets to flourish.  •	Prioritized, incremental investment in a diverse, enabling energy future Significant, ongoing investment will be required to ensure a constant emphasis on innovation to drive efficiency and excellence.  •	Clear understanding Society must have a clear understanding of the life cycle value of any energy decisions & their true implications including the full price of all environmental policies and the impacts on the capacity and resilience of existing energy networks.  For energy to remain reliable and affordable we must continue to leverage existing infrastructure and, using a combination of policy, regulations and market forces, innovate in the areas that can most effectively help improve our economic and environmental performance.  Summary  In short, the future means people will have the same human needs they have today, but will want them addressed sooner, more cost effectively and more reliably – and industry will need to respond to those needs, and government will need to keep in place the conditions to allow industry to respond.  We in the gas industry believe we will be a part of that future and are staying as nimble as possible to assure that.  The industry must aggressively pursue new alliances, non-traditional business models & forward-thinking strategies while always remaining focused on the superior value it delivers to Canada’s economic prosperity & overall quality of life.    The industry will have to expand its scope & service offerings, drive innovation & technological change & continually strive to be the most efficient full-services organizations possible.  The Canadian natural gas delivery industry fully understands its essential role in the energy future of the country & stands ready to work with all stakeholders in building the necessary methodologies to help achieve Canada’s goals of better environmental performance, affordable energy & economic prosperity & innovation.",,Industry or Business,Industrie ou entreprise,Oil Sands; Industry,Sables bitumineux; Industrie,Natural Gas; Pipelines; Renewables; Innovation,Gaz Naturel; Pipelines; Énergies renouvelables; Innovation,11,,0,

60,20-Sep-17,Idea/Idée,Create Canadian National Standards for Biomass Supply Chain Risk,,"Industry Challenge One of the key challenges to the rate of growth of the bioenergy industry in Canada is that risks associated with biomass supply chains are not well understood. While concerns about technology, construction, and offtake have clear paths to resolution, at present there are no established protocols, standards, or even recognized industry best practices that developers, investors, commercial lenders, insurance companies and rating agencies can utilize and rely upon to empirically demonstrate supply chain risk. In the bioenergy field, certification processes and standards have been recently developed with regard to pellet quality. Standards help create a lingua franca among suppliers and buyers and create market efficiencies - efficiencies that have been key to the growth the Canadian export pellet industry in recent years. However, a properly standardized, recognized and accepted risk-based methodology and tool set to assess bioenergy supply chain risks under varying economic, technical and climatic scenarios has not yet been developed. The lack of a standardized and recognized approach (consisting of standards, methodologies and tools) means that bioenergy stakeholders are independently using inconsistent approaches and evaluation criteria, leading to unreliable assessments of project risks. Unclear understanding of risk also results in lower credit ratings for bioenergy projects: most are saddled with BBB minus ratings or less (junk bond territory). This results in significant project financing barriers for Canadian bioenergy projects and in millions of dollars of “financial-drag” on the projects that are eventually built: projects that are burdened with financing and debt cost up to 150 to 500 basis points higher than might otherwise have been required. Stern Brothers, a leading investment bank facilitating project financing for the renewable energy industry, confirms that this is a key challenge inhibiting bioenergy expansion. A solution to this problem lies in creating an established protocol or set of standards that gives credit agencies and commercial lenders a common approach and lingua franca when attempting to price feedstock risk. To the extent that standards and protocols are established to help capital markets better understand and price the risks inherent in biomass supply chains, capital will flow more easily to the projects seeking funding, and the rate of bioenergy project development in the Canada will increase. Objectives The primary objective of this project is to develop a framework of standards and certification protocols to allow companies in the biomass sector to clearly demonstrate the risk of their feedstock supply chain. The quantitative risk assessment architecture will provide the framework for development of a set of standards, indicators, guidelines, and recommended methods and tools to quantify supply chain risks and to rank and rate those risks on an objective and accepted scale. Targets/Milestones The architecture to assess biomass supply chain risk will include, (1) a set of proposed standards and definitions to assess the different types of risk that affect biomass supply chains and (2) a suite of methods and tools that can be used to quantitatively assess and rank those risks by probability and consequence.     Impacts and Outcomes The project outcome will be a published and validated framework of standards and a certification protocol that will provide the major credit rating agencies, commercial lenders, and bioenergy investors with a common and recognized means to evaluate and quantify the supply chain risks of Canadian bioenergy projects. The impact of this project is accretive and immediately transferable across the full spectrum of the bio-based industries: the benefits will impact bioenergy, advanced biofuels, bio-based heat and power, and pellet production, among others. The standardized and certified risk assessment process will reduce the level of uncertainty that is currently a main cause of low bioenergy project credit ratings and higher commercial debt costs. By so doing, it will unlock significant development potential in the bioenergy space and increase the rate of development of bioenergy projects in North America.    ",,Industry or Business,Industrie ou entreprise,,,Governance; Innovation; Biomass; Renewables,Gouvernance; Innovation; Biomasse; Énergies renouvelables,10,,0,

60,24-Sep-17,Comment/Commentaire,,,"I agree, Provincial and federal governments can play a large role in incentivising the development of the market. I worked for the District of Wells in BC for one summer and there are a fair amount of logistical challenges. However, if there are a few schools that want to hook up it can be viable. That said, even the chipper for a biomass boiler costs over $80,000 and that is a small one. A blower truck costing $300,000 plus is also needed.  A renewable heat incentive such as the one in the UK would be the best way forwards. If there is no guaranteed marketed, the investment would be tough to justify. Furthermore, many remote communities are on the natural gas grid in Canada. This is not the case in New England. Right now, natural gas is too cheap to make biomass thermal viable in many situations. However, as the market grows the costs will fall significantly.  Boiler costs here are nearly double than those in Europe.",,Employed in the energy industry,Les personnes employee par l’industrie énergie,,,,,,0,No/Non,

In Alberta, the government has wasted 4 billion dollars to shut down coal plants 10 years sooner when anybody who truly understands climate knows that Canada plays a symbolic role in world outcomes due to the extremely small percentage of world emissions we have.  There is no politician standing up for the costs impacting consumers. That issue is truly hitting home in Ontario now as consumers are being killed by the bad decisions made by their government to hand out long term power deals to renewable companies with no consideration to the impact it would have on consumer bills.  The same principles apply to the costs impacting our businesses trying to compete on a global scale. We will not attract business if our infrastructure / energy  costs are too high. We already have a huge advantage on a world scale based on the non-emitting hydro sources we currently have.  We need to look for ways to take advantage of our natural resources to support the transformation. Natural Gas is an excellent example where it can be used as a transportation fuel and through the use of CHP technology can help meet our climate goals and keep costs down for consumers and business. It can also be an excellent back up for renewables when the sun does not shine (see Canadian winter) and the wind does not blow.   ",,Industry or Business,Industrie ou entreprise,,,Governance; Affordability; Natural Gas,Gouvernance; Abordabilité; Gaz Naturel,13,,0,

60,2-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,Geologist in oil patch,,Canada needs economic engines for employment and revenue to support the quality of life we have had to date.  Now that the States no longer require as much oil and gas from us due to changes in technology ie horizontal drilling and fracking. So we need pipeline infrastructure such as Energy East which would provide employment at the corporations expense and deliver cheaper oil to eastern Canada safely. Currently eastern Canada imports oil from the Middle East at world prices via tankers. We need to do some nation building in a timely manner as this is a global economy with which we compete. The States now export both oil and natural gas. We can't even get our product to tidewater to export it. The Feds have a moritoriam on tankers along the west coast so even if they get the twinning of Kindermorgan going we can't export it.  If Canadians don't wake up soon we will be a third world country in 10-20 years. We have to responsibly exploit our resources. That's our bread and butter and always will be. Next year the amount of transfer payments will drop noticeably. That will be a wake up call to the east hopefully. Currently we are selling our oil and gas to the States at big discount losing millions everyday. They must love us.  We need to embrace capitalism. Socialist governments both federally and provincially will take our economy down by not growing it and taxing us to death. Ie coming after small businesses which are the risk takers that create economy and grow it. If there are no incentives for this then we will all eventually be depending on government to carry us through taxation as the main source of revenue. Alberta has sent over 200 billion dollars out of province to mainly eastern Canada with a large chunk going to Quebec. This is since ~2000. There's no way you can replace this economic engine with so called diversification. Good to diversify but huge shoes to try and fill. Time for some common sense and critical thinking to prevail otherwise Canada will be in deep trouble. There are several million kilometres of pipeline all over North America and fracking has been going on for over 50 years.

It goes even beyond energy, it is even the everyday products we use. Having said that oil will be used for many years yet, but hopefully it will be on the decline as other sources are affordable and usable. In the interim, we as Canadians can reduce pollution from non-renewable sources by sourcing them here instead of overseas. Sourcing them here is the right thing for several reasons. 1. Canada has by far a better record on environmental and human rights issues when it comes to the oil and gas sector when compared to those countries we often import from. If we shut down our development of oil and gas, another country, most of them with terrible records in these areas will step up and sell us the oil we use (they actually do already!), effectively increasing the amount of human rights and environmental abuses globally. As the world transition away from oil and gas, let's be leaders in developing the most environmentally friendly way of extracting and processing nonrenewable resources so that we are taking business away from those who have little or no value for those things. Stopping Canadian development only serves to increase worldwide pollution and abuses, relying on our own, is the best cure, because then the values we hold dear can be monitored locally rather than having no control over them. If we want to protest, oil extraction, lets start with the countries that have the worst records. 2. Importing resources when we have them locally, increases global pollution, because it adds pollution through the additional transportation required. 3. Developing locally, the taxes taken from those corporations, are, and can be funneled into developing alternative sources. Taking foreign resources, we have no tax base to draw from to begin the transition, it has to come from something else. As we transition away from oil and gas, the real solution is reducing our consumption, not stopping the development of them. That is the long term solution.

We could plant more trees to eliminate more co2 from our atmosphere. Save the marshes and the wetlands, not just for thier beauty but also for the oxygen they produce. If electric cars are going to take off, then there would have to be a more developed infrastructure to charge them, not just a couple of dozen quick charging stations in Ontario. I recently bought a car and that fact alone discouraged me from making that choice. And lastly less wastage, how much co2 do garbage trucks produce? And plastic and styrofoam never decompose because there is nothing organic in thier chemical makeup. So they will break down into a fine sand over millions of years and literally occupy our planet until the sun turns into a red giant. The garbage inside a garbage bag will also not decompose because in order for that to happen, the object must be surrounded by soil and the bag might stay in tact. Plus old food creates methane gas when it decomposes while exposed to air, which is ten times worse than co2 for the environment. ",,Academia or education,Académie ou éducation,,,Renewables; Solar,Énergies renouvelables; Solaire,0,,0,

60,5-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,Waste to Energy: Treatment of waste feedstock and creating renewable energy,,"Waste generation is a global challenge, including in Canada, and rising with population growth, urbanization, and consumption. Societies generate multiple waste streams — from MSW, waste biomass, hazardous, medical, construction, demolition, tires, food, e-waste, etc., that typically end-up in landfills with or without recycling. In some cases, waste streams (both hazardous and non-hazardous) is exported to other countries for treatment or simply landfilling. As a holistic 'circular-economy' approach, in-line with the waste hierarchy and 'zero' waste strategies, an integrated waste-to-energy (WTE) facility is one such solution. This could include a front-end material recycling facility (MRF), enabling separation of recyclable materials, followed by treatment of 'post-recycled' waste and create renewable energy. Alternatively, a WTE facility can be built alongside an existing MRF, share resources and avoid long-range transportation. However, the challenge to overcome is the cost. WTE facilities are dependent on waste tipping fees, long-term waste supply agreements, and power purchase agreements (PPAs) for sustainability and revenue generation. Currently, most jurisdictions already spend substantial budgets for waste and landfill management. This excludes the costs for CO2/MH4 emissions reduction and medical costs due to human health issues. If governments at both the federal and municipal levels could offset such costs (similar to other infrastructure funding), and considering mitigation of the above issues a priority, then the benefits overweigh costs. Simultaneously, long-term incentive models such as renewable energy certificates (REC) for energy generation and emissions reduction could be applied. This would enable recycling and reduction of waste, emissions reduction while providing a safe and healthy environment for all Canadians. This could be a win-win solution for generations to come.

60,5-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,Electric bikes,,"Creation of more bike lanes and encourage the use of small electric vehicles such as e-bikes or e-trikes where the carbon footprint is not only lower at the operating side, but also on the production side. As energy storage technology improves, the charge time required for such products will decrease. The research of graphene based capacitor, in theory, will allow full charging by simply taping a charging source. A small 500 watt hour battery on a typical ebike will charge in seconds. There are research sources that have compared co2 emissions of small, efficient cars to a cyclist riding a non-electric road bicycle and found that, taking into account the co2 generation of the processes of cultivating, harvesting, and transportation, it is actually more efficient to drive a small car. There is also reseach that shows cycling at moderate pace is healthy but cycling too much, be it at too high of an intensity or too long a duration, can be undesirable health wise. Electric bikes have the potential to resolve these issues. Canada should implement regulations that make travel by ebike, not only more affordable, but more safe and viable. Rather than implementing more costly bicycle lanes, it may be faster and more cost efficient to allow ebikes to be more compatable with our current roads. The state of California currently has a speed limit of 45 km/h and a power limit of 750 watts compared to the current limit of 32 km/h and 500 watts respectively in Canada. With a speed limit of 32km/h, a cyclist needs to generate 18km/h of speed in the face of wind resistance in order to keep up with traffic or have traffic constantly pass by. The latter represents one of the major hazards of cycling where not all drivers on the road are aware of the saftey regulations and do not give the cyclist enough room when passing and is one of the major reasons people refrain from using ebikes as an alternative form of transportation. Having a speed limit of 45 will allow cyclists to better keep up with traffic without over exerting the body and travel at a lower level of risk.    ",,Industry or Business,Industrie ou entreprise,Solar; Innovation; Smart Grid; Electricity; Heating/cooling; Energy Efficiency; Storage,Solaire; Innovation; Smart Grid; Électricité; Le chauffage et le refroidissement; Efficacité énergétique; Stockage d’énergie,Storage; Transportation; Electricity,Stockage d’énergie; Transports; Électricité,0,,0,

60,5-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,Toronto Traffic: Telecommute Incentive,,"As a Torontonian (GTA'er, to be specific), I have seen our traffic go from bad, to terrible, to intolerable. It is impacting the health and well-being of working citizens--and all levels of transportation, from individual vehicle, to public transit, and even to ""alternative"" options like bicycling. Bicycling is a sporadic choice for most except hard-core riders due to the general need to flow with traffic as bike lanes and dedicated systems are in some areas but not others.  As a human geography major in the 1990s, there was a sense that non-centralized and alternative means of work access were on the uptake. Virtual offices made sense: they were seen as a way to reduce overhead costs to large corporations, in particular. Technology made these home or satellite (work close to home) options viable.  Unfortunately, we are now grid-locked again, and worse than ever, as single individuals in cars, and GO trains, subways, and crammed buses ship the masses to 9-5 jobs of all varieties. There has to be a better way! What if businesses had incentives (tax based, or direct) for facilitating employees to work from home, or near home to alleviate pressure on our transportation systems? Anyone whose job could be done virtually vs in person. Perhaps a registry of businesses willing to incorporate this could also be implemented. Incentives could be percentage based, so a workplace that reduces on-site jobs and converts to from or near-home positions by 10% would see one level of incentive, a business at 15% would see a higher level, and so forth. How to justify the cost of these incentives? The idea would directly alleviate use of roads and public services. This reduced usage would make it eventually possible to save on road and public transportation growth/development costs (that can run into the millions or more). Meanwhile, employees not having to travel to and from a workplace for what can be as much as 6+ round-trip hours a day will be more productive, more likely to have additional available time, and be statistically healthier physically and mentally.",,Academia or education,Académie ou éducation,,,Transportation; Finance,Transports; La finance,0,,0,

Odd and counter-intuitive as this may seem, this is an easy, much less expensive way to remove vast quantities of flared and vented gas out of earth's atmosphere in one fell swoop. There are 78"" flare stacks in operation which burn more gas than some Canadian Explorers and Producers make for a living. We would still bring in emissions-mitigating regulations as are currently being formed for new-builds in Canada, but Canadians could take credit for reduced global GHG emissions on a huge scale. And it's a money maker? We can even make money doing this, as the captured and processed gas has commercial value. By entering into business partnerships with in-country polluters/producers and strong commercial support from EDC and the Canadian Trade Commissioners, we can make an big difference. My company works with this type of equipment for clients who buy Canadian extraction plants because the economics look good to them, even without the GHG calculations. Why not have Canada subsidize the equipment and take credit for the mitigation effect and take credit for our emissions reduction? Flare improvement has a similar effect. We have Canadian flameless flaring equipment already proving we can make a difference in Kuwait, Nigeria and elsewhere. As we're now committed to importing energy from a lot of these countries in increasing volumes (due to Energy East cancellation) for environmental reasons, we should be just as committed to reducing the carbon footprint of these imported hydrocarbons. How it works: Captured gas could be used to generate more reliable power or supply cleaner-burning energy to locals. Liquids extracted can be sold on international markets for profit. (Nigeria flares 3 Trillion Cubic Feet of gas per day! Just taking 1/3 of that out of the atmosphere would be the equivalent to building 14,000 windmills a year or removing 14 coal-fired plants a year!

Eat in restaurants. Go to the library. Take vacations. Go to the grocery store. Purchase groceries. Etc. All of these activities and myriad others depend on a cheap dependable source of oil and gas. To summarize, the demand for oil and gas continues. Consider then the upstream greenhouse gas emissions of oil production in Saudi Arabia to fill that demand unabated. Consider also, the ongoing greenhouse gas emissions of shipping that oil to Canada by super tanker. Several per week. With no end in sight. If these emissions were weighed against shipping oil to eastern Canada by pipeline from western Canada, I do believe it would prove vastly more economical, and produce far less emissions than super tanker. And note again, the end result is the same. Oil will be refined and shipped from eastern refiners to various locations for further distribution within Canada via pipeline.

60,6-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,A rational approach to planning a hydrogen-based energy infrastructure for the future,,"I would like to see a plan for initial development of a hydrogen fuelling infrastructure that would allow for travel between major communities. This approach would allow for the rational development of fuelling stations to facilitate the deployment of that fuel cell transport trucks.  I would also like to see centralized refuelling stations in major urban centres for urban public transit systems – a single refuelling point for city buses. This could be a starting point for the more widespread use of hydrogen as a fuel using fuel cells. I think that this will be an important contribution to a greener future, in combination with other technologies. In saying this, it's important to avoid the tendency to pit one form of energy improvement against another, i.e., I think that the future of transport will not be a question of either battery power or hydrogen fuel cell-based, but a combination of both. For vehicles that require frequent duty with short down time, e.g., city buses and heavy trucks on trunking operations, fuel cell approaches would seem to be more useful than batteries. For cars that will spend most of their life in an urban environment, batteries seem logical. For city buses, predictable routing around close proximity to a refuelling base lends itself to relatively easy installation of the required infrastructure at a central hub. For heavy trucks, it seems that the size of the battery required for an electric vehicle would be prohibitively costly in terms of payload. If genuinely renewable energy is used for the hydrolysis, e.g., solar, wind, and wave power, then hydrogen fuel use really does seem to offer the cleanest and most sustainable approach for the future. There is lots of research being done, and many breakthroughs being achieved, in increasing the energy efficiency of hydrolysis and in doing so using solely renewable energy inputs.  These breakthroughs include identification of cheaper, more abundant catalysts and move us closer and closer to emulating natural hydrolysis as occurs in photosynthesis in nature. Some have concerns about hydrogen being dangerous and explosive. However, so is gasoline, yet we have that transported everywhere now and in tanks in our vehicles. Therefore, similar safeguard-based approaches to hydrogen would apply and be acceptable.  Experience in California, Japan and Europe supports this. Fuel cell and H2 technology exists, reliability is proven (Ballard buses in London), fuel cells are getting cheaper (ITM Power), and the heavy truck industry is trialling fuel cells (Scania working with Hydrogenics). The infrastructure is needed for our future, but must be planned. Shell is already active in this area.  Like the first gasoline vehicles, there was no broad network of fuel stations when they first arrived, so there’s no reason why we can’t make this happen – but it will require planning. One final thought: using renewable energy for hydrolysis would eliminate the reliance on current geographic locations of fossil fuels, many of which are in environmentally sensitive areas and/or which are in areas hard to access (and physically dangerous). Given this, using hydrogen as a fuel source in conjunction with mobile and static fuel cells, every single country could become energy independent in due course. In terms of the planning to facilitate this, we could at the very least begin by identifying ideal locations throughout our road infrastructure for filling stations that would allow for refuelling for highest frequency truck routes.  California has developed a hydrogen highway on a similar basis.  Following this, debate could be pursued about the potential for subsidizing initial infrastructure development.  This approach could provide the starting point for further commercial development, ultimately without subsidization as soon as the first network becomes profitable.",,General public,Public générale,,,Hydrogen; Transportation; Storage; Renewables; Innovation,D’hydrogène; Transports; Stockage d’énergie; Énergies renouvelables; Innovation,0,,0,

60,6-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,Development of Canadian Biomass Feedstock Information Hub (BiFi Hub),,"Industry Challenge One of the key challenges to the rate of growth of the bioenergy industry in Canada is that although information pertaining to biomass supply is available, it is highly fragmented:  for bio-project developers, lenders and other industry stakeholders, obtaining relevant information requires accessing multiple sources of varying levels of depth, resolution, granularity, and accuracy. As a result the initial development process for biomass projects is slow and expensive. A centralized database or Hub of the right type of feedstock information relevant to developers and lenders would unlock huge potential in the rate of bio-project development. Accelerating Bio-project Development by Fast-tracking the Validation Phase Every biomass project, whether bio power, biochemical, bioenergy, or bio product, necessarily goes through a feedstock validation phase. In the Validation Phase, project developers / lenders need to:  Obtain a high-level understanding of the quantity quality, cost, competition for biomass resources available within a particular targeted geographic region (i.e. wood fiber, corn stover, sorghum, miscanthus, etc.) and Validate this high level data with more granular on-the-ground discussions with actual local suppliers and transportation companies.  The outcome of the Validation Phase is a “go / no-go” decision resulting in either deployment of additional time and dollars on a particular location or not. The validation phase is time-consuming, expensive and often a waste of limited development dollars and time: feedstock validation can take 2-3 months per geographic area and developers look at multiple locations before deciding to “drill down” (in a particular location) or not. Not only does this slow down the pace of development, it adds a needless layer of expense and financial drag upon the industry: bio-project developers can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars evaluating potential site locations only to discover that suitable feedstock is not available, that the cost is too high, or competition is too fierce. BiFi Hub will dramatically reduce the time required to gather appropriate validation information from months to hours and eliminate the associated expenses. Acceleration of the rate of bio-industry development is a key goal of federal and provincial governments. An important way to achieve this is to provide easier access for developers and lenders investment grade information in the Validation Phase. Accessibility and transparency of market information is generally regarded as central to the efficiency, liquidity and rate of development of any market. Better and easier access information can also serve as key inputs to improved decision-making by project developers, financial institutions, government, and other industry stakeholders.  This is particularly important in developing industries where the rate of development has been directly linked with the availability and accessibility of vital market information. Information aggregation and transparency initiatives, for example, have been key to rapid development of the pellet industry in Canada in recent years.  Hub Architecture and Data BiFi Hub will contain only data layers important for project developers and lenders to validate the viability of biomass feedstock supply and to speed project development.  7 data layers will be developed and for each of 5 categories of biomass feedstock: Forestry harvest and processing residue, Agricultural residues, Renewable Energy crops, Livestock manure and processing waste, and Food-based organic biomass (see Figure 1 in attached doc) Project Objectives The objective of BiFi Hub is to enable users to:  Determine Feedstock Availability:  Confirm the availability of sufficient quantities biomass within the project supply basin; Make a high-level projection of the minimum Biomass Availability Multiple.   Understand Feedstock Price  Determine the low / high cost of feedstock historically.   Gauge Competition  Map the location of major suppliers in relation to project site, and annual feedstock intake.   Start a conversation with real suppliers on a local level  Give contacts of actual suppliers of relevant feedstock.    Impacts and Outcomes The project outcome will be a deployment of a publicly available, powerful, validated, easily accessible, GIS and web-based platform which will enable developers, commercial lenders, government and other bio-industry stakeholders to make quick, accurate, high-level decisions related to feedstock. BiFi Hub will solve the issue of fragmented information that is currently a main cause of slow bioenergy project development in Canada. BiFi Hub will dramatically decrease the time and expense of the Validation Phase for bio-projects. By so doing, it will unlock significant development potential in the bioenergy space and increase the rate of development of bioenergy projects in Canada. Better availability of relevant information may further accelerate industry development by attracting international developers and lenders who are less familiar with the Canadian market and might otherwise avoid or delay participation.   Unlike many technological advances in the bioenergy space which benefit only a single industry sector, the impact of this project is accretive and immediately transferrable across the full spectrum of the bio-based industries: the benefits will impact bioenergy, advanced biofuels, bio-based heat and power, and pellet production, among others. Enhancing the availability and accessibility of important supply chain information is obviously not a panacea for all issues causing sluggish development of bio-based initiatives in Canada  today, and clearly many market participants already have their own means of acquiring feedstock information on which to base development decisions. Still, if rapid increase of the rate of national bio-based development is an important goal, it is clear that transparency and accessibility of relevant information is key to achieving it. BiFi Hub is the logical step to eliminating an important barrier to bio-project development in Canada.",,Industry or Business,Industrie ou entreprise,,,Renewables; Biomass; Information; Finance; Innovation,Énergies renouvelables; Biomasse; Information; La finance; Innovation,0,,0,

60,7-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,Perspectives on Waste-to-Energy Technologies,,"In response to Global Climate Change, there has been a requirement towards Waste-to-Energy technologies to produce alternative/ clean energy from waste feedstocks, such as MSW, industrial waste, medical waste, biomass waste, sewage sludge, used tires, etc. Typically, the waste is sent to landfills and the energy in waste is essentially lost, creating mountains of trash, emitting harmful pollutants into our air, water, and soil. The waste feedstock can be a cost-effective and environmentally sound supply of clean energy source and replace a portion of fossil fuels. Non-recyclable waste products (e.g. contaminated plastic, paper, diapers, medical waste, waste biomass, anaerobic digestion and industrial byproducts, etc.) are very difficult to recycle and reuse. Therefore, a Circular Economy should include the use of effective waste-to-energy technologies to extract energy from non-recyclable waste. The waste, potentially, can be transformed to various forms of clean energy products, such as electricity, hydrogen, liquid synthetic fuels, and “green” chemicals. The primary challenge of these technologies is the heterogeneous nature of waste, which creates a widely varying chemical constituency of the energy products generated from these processes. An effective Waste-to-Energy technology application in combination with a reliable scrubbing/ cleaning system can provide a solution for waste disposal and clean energy production. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/perspectives-waste-to-energy-technologies-zoltan-kish-ph-d-?trk=pulse_spock-articles",,Small business,Petites entreprises,Biomass; Bioenergy; Buildings,Biomasse; Bioénergie; Bâtiments,Efficiency; Renewables; Biomass; Affordability; Hydrogen,Efficiency; Énergies renouvelables; Biomasse; Abordabilité; D’hydrogène,0,,0,

The biggest issue is that they aren't retrofitted and fall into disrepair. This has left the way open for countries like China to take much of our resources away from our soil, and melt them down and repackage them while still utilizing the advancements of cheap labour and expendable people. Simply put, the reason our economy is a banana economy is because all of our copper goes overseas or to the USA, instead of creating value-added products at home, and if they are made at home, the cost is simply prohibitive. This is a catastrophe and I'd address it myself but I can't. Relying on foreign entities leaves our economy fragile, and anything that can be exported that is value-added will surely help in the long run, both for the bottom lines of everyone but also for security of the nation, even though ""value added"" these days is not nearly as lucrative as it once was. Some forges/smelters still are not well-insulated, do not have more advanced features like zinc-coating, or utilizing many cost-saving features (some estimates said costs could be reduced by 40% simply by utilizing recyclables as they are cleaner input feedstock, nevermind green initiatives which have already been proven to work). Why am I paying 50 cents for a copper piece that was made in china from Canadian sources?

60,10-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,Water conservation and heating is still severely untapped,,"There are products not available in Canada or are excessively cost prohibitive. There are toilets that only use 1 gallon of water and are primarily used in apartment buildings but conventional stores rarely stock them. Hinchcliffe and Hennessy, a Trenton Ontario based company, a Canadian company, produces these toilets, yet American Standard, Kohler, etc are still frequently marketed, and while the costs are lower, the overall costs are much, much higher in terms of water usage. How does this apply? Well, cleaning water costs money, and the chemicals required cost electricity (usually) to produce. Anything reducing the need for sodium-fluoride and chlorine to be added to the supply will not save on infrastructure costs, but will save on everyday running costs. How about mandating that water collection is not illegal? You can say it's for a watershed protection, but in my opinion, as long as Nestle isn't sucking the ground dry, I don't see why private citizens must put up with being told they can't collect garden water. Additionally, this will likely modestly reduce the strain on the storm drain infrastructure (which nobody has the money to upgrade yet). Some faucets only use 0.25LPM and are quite effective especially in conjunction with point of use hot water heating, but they are not available in Canada, at least I haven't seen it. Perhaps it is due to the idea that these extremely low flow options are less hygenic, in which case that too can be fixed with adequate research and awareness campaigns. Even for mobile homes, as long as they are connected to adequate pressure, can save a lot for those that have little. If the private sector refuses to streamline production chains and offer these products then it is the goal of government to mandate that these products are available and/or offer assistance to the companies doing the innovating so as to ramp up production and protect natural resources. As it is, the USA is undergoing crop failures due to lack of water. If we don't want to be like them, it needs to start at home, and of course in conjunction with this as has already been demonstrated in the news, infrastructure is needed in the case of flooding. On the other hand, conservation may reduce the stress of environments where there are wildfires, even though I have seen some trucks purposely dump water over roads to keep dust down or encourage evaporation (in Prince George, BC) while the rivers were already running dry and the fountain drinks tasted like dirt. Point is, you're really going to need adequate desalination and/or follow India's lead in increasing reservoir capacity to deal with storm surges (which is already, as far as I can recall, ""not in the budget"" for a good ten years, at least for Toronto... Why build more transportation infrastructure again?) Heating and solar panels (solar heating) are not optimized for installations. The costs of installation in North America as far as recent figures have shown, has shown that ""bloat"" has effectively doubled the price of installations in comparison to Germany. Really, the is likely due to a lack of discipline and no hard-and-fast rules for rapid rollout of panels, as panels can be of differing sizes and the housing of such varies and the frames must be welded. This lack of standardization and good installation practices has caused headaches to consumers and has scared some away from installing all manner of panels, both poly and evacuated tubing. I suggest running advertisements, not about freedom and children running, but aspiring to be the best you can be, to perfect your trade, to aspire to a higher standard in work, and in play.

However Trudeau fails to recognize this and still wants to punish them with the full carbon tax. There is no incentive for this from the Liberals. In 1999 another project in north East BC was proposed to capture the carbon in the Horn River Basin and ship it to the Zama oil field to be injected to enhance oil recovery. That project was killed because the BC government then wanted royalties on the CO2. This is not really about CO2 it is about taxes and money for the governments.,,General public,Public générale,,,,,,0,No/Non,

If the world price goes above the hypothetical $60/barrel price we aren’t obligated to pay more. The oil companies are locked in at that price but any surplus can be sold outside our borders at world pricing. Figuring into the price would be research and development to make the product cleaner and also for developement of other sources of cleaner energy. The governments could back off on some of their taxes at the pump to make it more affordable with the increase from the $50/barrel at today’s world price and the extra we would have to pay to keep big oil happy and productive.

This has also been successfully done in Canada, and back in the 1940’s by the state of Idaho. They succeeded in saving state park acreages by relocating 75 beavers. Idaho already built a carrier that floats gently to the ground and opens, after being dropped from an airplane. This process will work in Canada if done on a large scale, say 1000-2000 beavers to start with. These containers can be dropped by airplane and made out of biodegradable materials so they wouldn't need to be picked up. Within the past 10 years Canada tried this process, they were able to forest, what had previously been grasslands, within 5-7 years.  If nothing is done, Canada will loose it's beautiful forests. I also came across an article that said the state of WA recently tried this with 300 beavers. The first winter after they did this 2016 - 2017, all of the water reservoirs in California were refilled. Since water rises straight up, this program would turn the Canada into a huge humidifier. This program should be started along the western coast of Canada and winds will carry the moisture east. All this humidity will have a cooling effect on the country, to offset Global Warming. If this is successful, Canada could become a leader by teaching other northern countries the best way.   ",,General public,Public générale,,,,,19,,0,

We need scaleable electricity generation solutions that provide employment, use existing Canadian skill sets, are sustainable  and safe, take advantage of existing infrastructure and help us mitigate and adapt to a changing climate.  Ideally, these solutions should also help us bridge to a time where technology and consumer confidence in renewables achieves full buy-in from the public.     What is one solution? Molten salt nuclear reactors.  This technology is extremely efficient and has been around for decades.  Actually it was developed by the US Los Alamos lab concurrently with heavy water reactor technology.  However, at the time, plutonium was needed as a by-product to enable the development of nuclear weapons and so heavy water technology was prioritized.  Molten salt reactors, in particular Thorium reactors, don’t create by-products that can be used for nuclear weapons, not even for dirty devices.   An additional benefit is that this technology operates at standard atmospheric pressure.  As a result, it is impossible for negative meltdown events to occur such as the events at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl or more recently, Fukushima, Japan.  In fact, when leaving the lab for the weekend, engineers at the Los Alamos Lab would just let the molten salt reactors “melt down” as a way or turning them off.  The core just turns to a solid with no radiological leakage. On Monday morning, they would just hear it up again and start generating electricity.   Just a few other considerations.  Thorium is highly abundant in existing mine tailings, something that Canada has in significant volume.  So, while it requires some light processing before entering the reactor as fuel (like other nuclear fuels), we don’t have to mine it out the ground.  In fact, just one ton of Thorium produces as much energy as 200 tons of uranium or 3.5 million tons of coal.  Efficiency win! Thorium reactors produce less than one percent of the waste created by our modern uranium nuclear reactors.  The reactors are tiny too, requiring a fraction of a typical reactor footprint and because of their inherent safety, can be positioned closer to urban centres.  Less transmission distance is, you guessed it, another efficiency win.   But what about waste?  Nobody likes barrels of nuclear waste being buried in Canada for the next ten thousand years.  I couldn’t agree more.  Thorium reactors eat existing nuclear waste for breakfast, literally.  It’s true, they do still create a bit of waste, but when balanced against what they consume, and the fact their waste is more stable and becomes benign in a much shorter time frame, the picture still looks quite rosy. Interestingly, India, who along with China, have the worlds most significant and increasing demand for electricity, has embraced molten salt reactors, including Thorium. The country already has several of these reactors in operation.   The technology is sustainable, time-tested, safe, uses existing infrastructure and Canadian skills, is shovel-ready, diversifies our energy supply and is complimentary to renewables.   Let’s consider molten salt reactors, and thorium reactors in particular, for a significant role in the Canadian energy supply.   ",,Academia or education,Académie ou éducation,,,Labour Markets; Nuclear; Innovation,Marché du travail; Énergie Nucléaire; Innovation,5,,0,

60,13-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,"Squandered Opportunity - Lost Jobs, Lost Tax Revenues, Increased Reliance on Despots",,"Environmental activists are celebrating the cancellation of the Energy East Pipeline, and are now redoubling their effort to kill the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain line as well.  They think that by stopping pipeline construction in Canada, they will stop greenhouse gasses, and stop any danger of oil spills.  How wrong they are.  Liquid petroleum products (gasoline, diesel fuel, lubricants and other chemicals) are essential for transportation and industry.  Despite massive, uneconomic government subsidies, non-oil energy sources have only replaced a tiny fraction of this fuel requirement, and limitations in battery technology are preventing further progress.   All environmentalists have done by their pipeline blockades is to ensure that the oil we need to keep industry alive is bought from the United States or from violent, despotic regimes like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, and that it is transported by rail and highway in ways that are far more prone to accidents (e.g., Lac Magantic) than pipelines ever will be.  In truth, their opposition to pipelines increases the danger to the environment.  Anti-pipeline activists do more harm than just that.  By preventing Canadian oil from being transported to large cities where it is needed and refined in Canada, they force us to deplete hard-earned foreign currency reserves, and prevent any jobs or tax revenue from staying here at home.  This is a classic “lose-lose-lose” scenario.  Canada has world-class engineering capability to build safe, efficient, cost-effective pipelines in our harsh climate and rugged geography.  There are Canadian companies ready and well-equipped to build these pipelines, but government tinkering with the regulatory approval process for political gain has made it impossible for them to proceed.  The legacy of this government action will be job losses, capability losses as these companies leave Canada, increased reliance on unsavoury foreign suppliers, and a deteriorating balance of trade.  What we need is a new government approach that recognizes our need for oil-based fuels now and into the foreseeable future, and enacts policy and legislation to bring our own oil to market for the benefit of all Canadians.",,General public,Public générale,Fossil Fuels; Industry; Climate Change; Environment,Combustibles fossiles; Industrie; Chandements climatiques; L’environnement,Petroleum; Natural Gas; Labour Markets; Pipelines; Finance; International,Pétrolier; Gaz Naturel; Marché du travail; Pipelines; La finance; Internationale,0,,0,
60,13-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,Develope a realistic atomospheric C02 minimum target. no CO2=no food,,"Carbon dioxide is critical to plant growth and development. Photosynthesis, the process through which plants use light to create food, requires carbon dioxide. CO2 concentration in ambient air ranges from 300-500 parts per million (ppm), with a global atmospheric average of about 400 ppm. If you are growing in a greenhouse or indoors, the CO2 levels will be reduced as the plants use it up during photosynthesis. Increasing the CO2 levels in these environments is essential for good results. Additionally, there are benefits to raising the CO2 level higher than the global average, up to 1500 ppm. With CO2 maintained at this level, yields can be increased by as much as 30%! Reduce CO2 to much and food production will plummet.  ",,General public,Public générale,,,Renewables; Biomass,Énergies renouvelables; Biomasse,0,,0,

60,13-Oct-17,Idea/Idée,How to Help Alberta,,"The elected representatives across Canada have decided not to support the pipelines needed by Alberta to Market its Natural Resource. The job loss impact of low oil prices and limited and delayed pipelines by governments is hitting Alberta Hard. Alberta has contributed billions annually for a great many years. All of this is well known. Canada should now come to Alberta with repayments. The country has apparently been ashamed to be known as an Oil Producer so the imposition of an import tax on oil of $5.00 per barrel on this product would fit right into the policies of the current elected Governments. These funds would go directly to Alberta thereby adjusting the harm done to Alberta by the rest of Canada.  Alberta could only use this source of revenue to pay off its debt incurred up to the point of oil dropping below $60.00 per barrel. Alberta must also learn to live within its means. In the event Alberta's acquired debt as listed is paid off, Ottawa would have the choice of continuing the import tax and adding it to the national coffers or ending it.",,General public,Public générale,Fossil Fuels; Innovation; Clean Tech,Combustibles fossiles; Innovation; Les technologies propres,Pipelines; Petroleum; Natural Gas; Finance,Pipelines; Pétrolier; Gaz Naturel; La finance,0,,0,
